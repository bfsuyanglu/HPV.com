    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">What is HPV?</h2>
    <img src="images/3.png" width="350">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Human papillomavirus, or HPV, is a common virus that affects both males and females. There are more than 100 types of the virus. In fact, certain types of HPV cause common warts on the hands and feet. Most types of HPV are harmless, do not cause any symptoms, and go away on their own. About 40 types of HPV are known as genital HPV as they affect the genital area. Up to 80% of people will be infected with at least one genital type of HPV at some time in their lives. Anyone who has had any kind of sexual activity involving genital contact could get genital HPV. Genital HPV types may be “high-risk” types (such as HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58) or “low-risk” types (such as HPV types 6 and 11). “High-risk” HPV types can cause cervical cancer and some vaginal, vulval and anal cancers. “Low-risk” HPV types can cause genital warts. Both the “high-risk” and “low-risk” types of HPV can cause abnormal changes.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Human papillomavirus, or HPV, is a common virus that affects both males and females. Up to 80% of people will be infected with at least one genital type of HPV at some time in their lives. HPV is easily spread through direct skin to skin contact. Anyone who has had any kind of sexual activity involving genital contact could get genital HPV. That means it’s possible to get the virus without having intercourse. And, because many people who have HPV may not show any signs or symptoms, they can transmit the virus without even knowing it. A person can be infected with more than one type of HPV. In most people, HPV is harmless and has no symptoms, but in some people the virus may persist and lead to diseases of the genital area, including genital warts and cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva and anus. Genital HPV infection is not something to feel embarrassed or ashamed about.

    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">How do you get HPV?</h2>
    <img src="images/7.jpg" width="350">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Intercourse is the most common way people get the virus. Some other factors increase the risk of contracting the HPV virus. These include:
    </p>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: rgb(84, 84, 84);">Having a higher number of intimate partner</span><span style="color: #000000; "></span>
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: rgb(84, 84, 84);">Having sex with someone who has had several intimate partners</span><span style="color: #000000; "></span>
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(84, 84, 84);"><span style="color: rgb(84, 84, 84);">Having a weakened immune system, for example, due to HIV or after having an organ transplant</span><span style="color: #000000; "></span>
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: rgb(84, 84, 84);">Having areas of damaged skin</span><span style="color: #000000; "></span>
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: rgb(84, 84, 84);">Having personal contact with warts or surfaces where HPV exposure has occurred</span><span style="color: #000000; "></span>

    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Can HPV be prevented?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        As HPV is a common virus and is so easily passed on, it is quite difficult to prevent yourself from being infected. But there are still ways to help you lower the possibility of being bothered by the virus. These include:
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 15px; background-color: transparent;">Safe Sex</h3>
    <img src="images/8.jpg" width="350">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        If used correctly, condoms can help reduce the risk of genital HPV, and also provide protection against other sexually transmitted diseases. However, because HPV is transmitted through genital skin contact (not just sexual intercourse) condoms don’t provide 100% protection against HPV.
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 15px;">Cervical Screening</h3>
    <img src="images/9.jpg" width="350">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        For females, your risk of developing cervical cancer can be reduced with cervical screening. Talk to your doctor for more information.
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-size: 15px; font-style: italic;">Vaccination</h3>
    <img src="images/2.jpg" width="350">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        There are vaccines available for certain types of HPV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend vaccination at the age of 11 to 12 years, to reduce the risk of cervical and other cancers developing in future. The vaccine is given in two doses, 6 to 12 months apart. Catch-up vaccines are recommended for males up to the age of 21 years and females up to 26 years who did not receive the vaccination at a younger age. Gay and bisexual men are encouraged to have the vaccination up to the ages of 26 years. Currently, there are three HPV vaccines on the market: Gardasil, Cervarix, and Gardasil 9. Speak with a doctor to see if vaccination is appropriate.
